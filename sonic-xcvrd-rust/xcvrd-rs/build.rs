//! Build script — make the unit-test binary loadable in the build container.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//! The daemon links `libswsscommon` (STATE_DB C++ bindings). The unit tests use the
//! crate's MOCK DB/HAL seams and never touch Redis, but the compiled test binary is
//! still *dynamically linked* against `libswsscommon.so.0`, so the loader must
//! resolve it — and its whole transitive closure — when the binary RUNS.
//!
//! The pipeline's build image (`tools/dut/Dockerfile.build`, `rust:trixie` + build
//! deps) is a *build-only* environment: the intended pattern (see `tools/dut/
//! env_check.sh`) is to build swss-linked binaries here and RUN them inside pmon,
//! which has the runtime libraries. But `tools/unit_test.sh` runs `cargo test`
//! *in the build container*, which has neither `libswsscommon.so.0` on the loader
//! path nor its closure (`libzmq`, `libhiredis`, `libboost_serialization`,
//! `libyang`, `libnl-*`). Without this script the test binary aborts at startup with
//! `libswsscommon.so.0: cannot open shared object file`.
//!
//! ## What this does (all confined to the build container / its mounts)
//! 1. Bakes `/swsslib` into the binary's RUNPATH. The harness stages pmon's
//!    `libswsscommon.so` there (via `ensure_swsslib.sh`) and mounts it read-write.
//! 2. Best-effort stages `libswsscommon`'s runtime closure into that same `/swsslib`
//!    dir (installing the trixie packages that provide the exact SONAMEs, then
//!    copying the resolved objects next to `libswsscommon.so`). Because `/swsslib`
//!    is a persistent host mount shared by every tool invocation, this is a one-time
//!    cost: once staged, later `cargo build`/`cargo test` runs skip it.
//!
//! Everything here is best-effort and never fails the build: `build_check.sh` only
//! compiles (it never runs the binary), and the deployed daemon runs in pmon where
//! the closure already exists and `/swsslib` doesn't (so the extra RUNPATH entry is
//! simply skipped by the loader). It only *matters* for `cargo test`'s in-container
//! run.
